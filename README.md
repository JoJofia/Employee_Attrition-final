## Project overview

Employee retention is one of the most important factors that drives a company's competitive advantage. Conversly, employee attrition, particularly abnormal trends, impacts the company's bottom line.  As we know, attrition of employees cannot be avoided but there have several reasons for employee attrition. Our group will doing the data analysis using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to better help company understand and how to do on the interventions. It will be most effective in reducing unwanted attrition.
    
    
## Topic for project

Identify the factors that are driving employee attrition and using these insights to predict who are at risk of leaving the company.

## Reason We Chose This Topic
Attrition is very relevant and relatable to most of us because we've all had jobs that we've left - for various reasons. Each company is its own ecosystem made up of intricate factors that then make up its unique culture.  For this particular project, we will examine what is driving IBM employees to leave, use the data to inform the areas the company need to assess and improve and also be able to accurately predict who are at risk of leaving based on the machine learning model we've created.

## Project Details
Communication protocols: The team will leverage various communication channels to facilitate the project.

We will spend a large portion of virtual class time to plan, discuss, delegate, and support one another on task assignments and spend the time working together virtually.

Outside of dedicated class time on Tuesday and Thursday, the team will utilize a private Slack channel while working async and communicate updates, questions, etc.

If needed, the team will also be setting up dedicated meetings outside of class hours.

Preliminary data preprocessing The team has reviewed and discussed each data column in the raw file, which data columns should keep and drop for the model, and which data types would need to be transformed.

Columns that were dropped are data that we anticipate are not the driving factors of the attrition and are therefore not necessary to include. For example, the employee count and over18 columns or departmentname.

We will need to transfer certain data that are currently in string format into integer for machine learning purposes. For example, “attrition” is currently yes/no and will need to be converted to 0 and 1, gender (converting male and female to 0 and 1), and marital status (converting single, married, and divorced to 0, 1, and 2).

Preliminary feature engineering and selection The team will be using Postgres to feed data into our machine learning models.

### In order to use the best model for the analysis, the team will be testing out all **six models**:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Basic Neural Network
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Deep Learning Model
5. Random Forest
6. Deep Learning Model

After the results are pulled, the team will utilize Tableau to visualize the findings and insights.

Data exploration phase The team is in the progress of cleaning and extracting the data. The team will enter the data exploration phase after the data is ready to be reviewed.

Analysis phase Given that the team is still working on cleaning and extracting data, we will begin the analysis once the data is ready to be ingested in the machine learning models.
