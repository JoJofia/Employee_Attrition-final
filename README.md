## Project overview

Employee retention is one of the most important factors that drives a company's competitive advantage. Conversly, employee attrition, particularly abnormal trends, impacts the company's bottom line.  As we know, attrition of employees cannot be avoided but there have several reasons for employee attrition. Our group will doing the data analysis using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to better help company understand and how to do on the interventions. It will be most effective in reducing unwanted attrition.
    
## Topic for project

Identify the factors that are driving employee attrition and using these insights to predict who are at risk of leaving the company.

## Reason We Chose This Topic
Attrition is very relevant and relatable to most of us because we've all had jobs that we've left - for various reasons.   Each company is its own ecosystem made up of intricate factors that then make up its unique culture.  For this particular project, we will examine what is driving IBM employees to leave, use the data to inform the areas the company need to assess and improve and also be able to accurately predict who are at risk of leaving based on the machine learning model we've created.

## Project Details
Preliminary data preprocessing
   The team has reviewed the raw data by reviewing and discussing which data columns should keep and drop, and which data types would need to be transformed. 

   Columns there are being dropped are data that are not the driving factors of the attrition. For example, the employee count and over18 columns. 

   There are data in string format that need to be converted into integral for machine learning use. Such as data in the attrition column (converting yes and no to 0 and 1), gender (converting male and female to 0 and 1), and marital status (converting single, married, and divorced to 0, 1, and 2)

Preliminary feature engineering and selection
   The team will be using SQL Lite to pull the raw data creating tables for our machine learning use. 

   In order to use the best model for the analysis, the team will be testing out all six models.
      Logistic Regression 
      Basic Neural Network
      Support Vector Machine
      Deep Learning Model
      Random Forest 
      Deep Learning Model

	After the results are pulled, the team will use Tabealue to visualize the data. 

Data exploration phase
   The team is in the progress of cleaning and extracting the data. the team will enter the data exploration phase after the data is ready to be reviewed. 

Analysis phase
   Given that the team is still working on cleaning and extracting data. The analysis phase will be entered, once the data is ready to be used for machine learning.
