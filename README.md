## Project overview

Employee retention is one of the most important factors that drives a company's competitive advantage. Conversly, employee attrition, particularly abnormal trends, impacts the company's bottom line.  As we know, attrition of employees cannot be avoided but there have several reasons for employee attrition. Our group will doing the data analysis using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to better help company understand and how to do on the interventions. It will be most effective in reducing unwanted attrition.
    
## Topic for project

Identify the factors that are driving employee attrition and using these insights to predict who are at risk of leaving the company.

## Reason We Chose This Topic
Attrition is very relevant and relatable to most of us because we've all had jobs that we've left - for various reasons.   Each company is its own ecosystem made up of intricate factors that then make up its unique culture.  For this particular project, we will examine what is driving IBM employees to leave, use the data to inform the areas the company need to assess and improve and also be able to accurately predict who are at risk of leaving based on the machine learning model we've created.

## Project Details
Communication protocols
   The team will be spending the class time discussing the project details and task assignments and spending the time working together virtually, in case any teammate needs any support from the team. 

   Outside of class time, the team has formed a private Slack channel communication. 

   If needed, the team will also be setting up a time to meet outside of class hours. 


Preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process
   The team has reviewed the raw data by reviewing and discussing which data columns should keep and drop, and which data types would need to be transformed. 

   Columns there are being dropped are data that are not the driving factors of the attrition. For example, employee count, employee number, and over18. 

   There are data in string format that need to be converted into integral for machine learning use. Such as data in the attrition column (converting yes and no to 0 and 1), gender (converting male and female to 0 and 1), and marital status (converting single, married, and divorced to 0, 1, and 2)
